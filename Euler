#Problem 1
#First I want to makea set of all multiples of 3 from 1 to 999
>>>a = set(xrange(0,1000,3)) 
#Now a set of multiples of 5
>>>b = set(xrange(0,1000,5))
#I want a sum of all the elements in both sets excluding multiples, so I'll create a new set of the union of the two
>>>c = a.union(b)
#Now I just need to sum all the elements in c
>>>s = sum(c)
>>>print s
233168

#Problem 2
##first I need a function that will give me the fibonacci sequence
>>>def Fib(n):
	if n == 1: return 1
	elif n == 2: return 2
	else: return Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2)
##the sum s starts at zero
>>>s=0
##I want the first imput of Fib to be 1
>>>i=1
##I want a loop that adds Fib(i) to s only if it is divisible by 2 with zero remainder and stop when Fib(i) reaches 4 million
>>>while Fib(i) <=4000000:
	if Fib(i)%2 == 0:
		s=s+Fib(i)
	i=i+1
>>>print s
4613732

#Problem 3
##I want n to start as 600851475143 and reduce down to the largest prime factor
>>>n=600851475143
##The first factor will be one
>>>f=1
##since f is a factor of n, it should not be bigger than the square root of n, so the loop should stop before f*f=n 
>>>while f*f < n:
	while n%f == 0: #n divided by f gives zero remainder, meaning f is a factor of n
		n=n/f #divides n down to a factor until there is no more factors left, meaning n is now prime
	f=f+1
>>>print n
