#Problem 1
#First I want to makea set of all multiples of 3 from 1 to 999
>>>a = set(xrange(0,1000,3)) 
#Now a set of multiples of 5
>>>b = set(xrange(0,1000,5))
#I want a sum of all the elements in both sets excluding multiples, so I'll create a new set of the union of the two
>>>c = a.union(b)
#Now I just need to sum all the elements in c
>>>s = sum(c)
>>>print s
